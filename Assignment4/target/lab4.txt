1. git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git
2. change directory to diffutils, then use git log > git-log.txt
3. git tag > git-tags.txt
4. I went to emacs and found out the commit's hash number is 62ca21..
   Then use the command "git show 62ca21 > quote-patch.txt
5. git checkout v3.0
6. patch -p0 quote-patch.txt
   Hit return to skip files.
7. git status
   It showed a list of modified and untracked files.
8. This step is to read about certain emacs functions.
9. For each file other than c file, I used emacs to edit it and used the comman
d  "C-x v ="
   "C-x v u" to revert all the changes.
   An alternative way to do this is using the command "git checkout NEWS README
 TODO doc/diagmeet.note ms/config.bat ms/config.site po/en.po src/diff.h src/sy
stem.h tests/help-version"
   Then I used emacs to edit all the other .c files and reverted all the 
changes in comments.
10. I found two patches needed to add through diff.c.rej and diff3.c.rej. Then
I applied the changes manually by going into the diff.c and diff3.c files.
11. I used "git clean -f" to remove all untracked files.
12. I used "git status" to check the remaining files and "git diff > quote-3.0
-patch.txt" to put the patch into the file.
13. I first changed the path using command "export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
"
   Then I used: 
   	   ./bootstrap
           ./configure
	   make
	   make check
14.  I used the command:
            mv diffutils diffutils-patch
            to rename the patched diffutils.
     Then I used the command:
       	    git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git
     to reclone diffutils
     And then use the commands:
	    cp -ar diffutils/src diffutils-3.0
	    cp -ar diffutils-patch/src diffutils-3.0-patch
     to put the source codes.
     To run my diff:
     	    diffutils-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch 
	    > quote-3.0-test.txt
15. I used the command:
    diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt
    to compare the diffrence.
    They are not identical, but the differences are innocuous. Basically they 
are just a few changes in backticks vs single quotes in comments.
