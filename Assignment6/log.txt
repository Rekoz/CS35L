First, I installed the OpenSSH
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install openssh-server
       sudo apt-get install openssh-client

I first was the client, so after my partner set up the server, I used the
commands (My username was User1 and password was 123456. IP address was 
10.97.85.235):
	ssh-keygen // generate keys
	ping server_ip_addr // test delay
	ssh-copy-id -i <UserName>@server_ip_addr //copy public key to the 
		       				   server
	ssh-add // add private key to agent
	ssh -X User1@10.97.85.235
	xterm
	firefox // run software on server

Then I switched to be the server (I set username to User2 and password 123456):
     sudo useradd -d /home/User2 -m User2 // add user
     sudo passwd User2 (then typed in password) // set password
     cd /home/
     sudo mkdir .ssh // create .ssh directory
     sudo chown -R User2 .ssh // change ownership
     sudo chmod 700 .ssh // change permission
     ifconfig // gives me the IP address
     ps aux | grep ssh // showed a process named 'sshd'
Then my partner was able to access my server.
