Reproduce the problem:
$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yunong csugrad 0 2015-04-28 07:31:06.302055177 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yunong csugrad 0 2015-04-28 07:30:59.245772463 +0000 now
-rw-r--r-- 1 yunong csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice

~/Assignment5/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt .
-rw-r--r-- 1 yunong csugrad 0 1918-11-11 03:00 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 yunong csugrad 0 2015-04-28 00:31 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yunong csugrad 0 2015-04-28 00:30 now
The result is as if the wwi-armistice file is newer than now1 and now, which is
unreasonable.

--------------------------------------------------

Debugging:
I used emacs to open ls.c and inspected the source code. I found that 
sort_files calls compare_mtime, which calls cmp_mtime, which calls 
timespec_cmp. So I set a break point at cmp_mtime and watched diff. I found
that when a.tv_sec = 1430464883 and b.tv_sec = -1613826000 (which is the time
stamp of wwi-armistice), diff=a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec returns a negative number.
It is obvious that there was an overflow. So I changed the corresponding diff's
type from int to long int, and the problem is solved.

Generate patch:
      diff -u coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h coreutils-fixed/lib/timespec.h
      > lab5.diff
And then I manually added the ChangeLog to the top of the diff file.

I checked the diff file by downloading another coreutils-with-bug file and
applied the patch using the command:
	patch -p1 < lab5.diff
inside the coreutils-with-bug directory. The result is correct.

--------------------------------------------------

To reproduce the problem in my home directory, I copied the files from tmp.
The problem here is that my home directory's file system uses 32-bit signed
integers, while the SEASnet server uses 64-bit. As a result after the file is
copied to home directory, the top 32 bits including the sign bit are thrown 
away, resulting in a big positive integer number.
